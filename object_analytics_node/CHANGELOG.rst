------------------
* Merge pull request `#55 <https://github.com/intel/ros2_object_analytics/issues/55>`_ from intel/devel
  update launcher file and license

* Merge pull request `#54 <https://github.com/intel/ros2_object_analytics/issues/54>`_ from nuclearsandwich/dependencies
  Reconcile dependencies between package.xml and CMakeLists.txt
* Merge pull request `#53 <https://github.com/intel/ros2_object_analytics/issues/53>`_ from intel/devel
  remove depth_image_proc when launch
* Add ament_index dependencies to the package manifest.
  Failures due to these missing dependencies were encountered on the ROS
  buildfarm. I added ament_index_python as an exec depend as it appears to
  be used by the launch files included with the package.
* remove depth_image_proc when launch
  depth_image_proc will has reduce image transport performance, subscribe pointcloud from camera directly, although there has blue points. To fix later with good performance.
* Merge pull request `#52 <https://github.com/intel/ros2_object_analytics/issues/52>`_ from intel/for_release
  For release
* add BUILD_TRACKING option
  Add BUILD_TRACKING option in order to disable tracking build for crystal bloom release, as opencv3.3 no provided debian installation from ubuntu18.04
* remap topic in launch instead of code hardcode
  remap topic name in launch.py instead of hardcode in code

* Merge detected object in localization and tracking
  Merged detected object_name and probability in localization and tracking object,
  so that users could only subscribe localization or tracking, needn't sub detected object
  and needn't do message fileter again.

* splite pointcloud2 to rgb and xyz
  Currently localization using pcl segementation api which not required rgb,
  this patch splited Pointcloud2 to XYZ, reduced half size of PointCloud2 (from 9.83M reduce to 4.91M)
  imporved pointcloud2 sub-pub transport performance.
