Changelog for package object_analytics_rviz
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

0.5.1 (2018-12-06)
------------------
* Merge pull request `#54 <https://github.com/intel/ros2_object_analytics/issues/54>`_ from nuclearsandwich/dependencies
  Reconcile dependencies between package.xml and CMakeLists.txt
* fix error in CTest
* Add ament_lint_auto dependency to package manifest.
  This package is required when BUILD_TESTING is enabled but is not in the
  package manifest and is causing failures on the ROS buildfarm.
  I added ament_lint_common since that seems to be the practice when using
  ament_lint_auto but I do not know whether that's necessary or desired in
  this case.
